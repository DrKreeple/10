# THIS PAGE SHOWS YOU THE FREQUENCY OF ALL THE TILES THAT CAN SPAWN IN 10

This list starts with the most common tiles and ends at the rarer ones.

1 - Almost every tile. Okay not really, if you hold down an arrow key for long enough you will not only get 1s.

THE 2 REALM

2 - The 2 Realm is 1 in every 625 tiles. 2 Realms are basically always 2s. Rumours say that there is a one in million chance you get a bug.

THE 3 REALM

3 - The 3 Realm is 1 in every 2000 tiles. However, on average only 80% of 3 Realms are 3s.
4 - 4s spawn 1 in every 5 3s. 20% of 3 Realms are 4s.
- - There is a not so secret 3 Realm called "dash" as it looks like a small dash. It is 1 in every 150000 3 Realms.

THE 5 REALM

5 - The 5 Realm is 1 in every 20000 tiles. To get a 5, you must not pick a 10% chance and then not pick a 20% chance.
6 - 6s spawn 1 in every 5 5s.
7 - To get a 7 you must pick a 10% chance instead of a 5 or a 6. Then you must not get an 8 instead.
8 - To get an 8 instead of a 7, you must get a 25% chance.
5.5 - To get this cool 5 Realm, you must get a 1 in 5000 chance.

THE 9 REALM

9 - The 9 Realm is 1 in every 1000000 tiles. To get a 9, you must not get a 2% or 10% or 20% chance.
10 - 10s are 1 in every 5 9s. You need to get two of these to win!
11 - If you get the 10% chance instead of 9 or 10 you could get an 11 or a 12. 3 out of 4 of these will be 11s.
12 - 12s spawn 1 in every 4 11s.
13 - To get a 13, you must get a 2% (1 in 50) chance instead of all of 9-12. Then you must not get a 1 in 6 or a 1 in 3 chance.
14 - 14s are 1 in every 3 13s. Like 13s, you must not get the 1 in 6 chance.
15 - If you do get the 1 in 6 chance, then 2 out of 3 of these will be 15s.
16 - The rarest 9 realm, 16 is 1 in every 3 15s. They are on average 1 in 900 9 realms.

49 - As a priority over the 9 realm, if at any time your game decides to pick a 1 in 2000000 chance, you get a 49.
